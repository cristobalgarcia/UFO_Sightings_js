# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project
The purpose of the project is to filter JSON data into organized and user friendly HTML and filtered site. This all includes creating filter variables to adjust from data being input on the search bar. Then creating a loop to go through the data to match search criteria. 
## Results

The search filter can be very useful for users as it simplifies the data. The below search filter can be found on the left side of the site. One can use the below search bars to find any data based on the element description.

Using the below data table that is found on the right side of the site, one can use the table columns to see what can input on the search filter to bring up certain data that is needed.

For example, if we want to find all UFO sightings for the city of Fresno, you would input the word Fresno under "Enter City" like the image below and then press enter.

The search will lead you to one sighting with it's details as to shape, description and date.

## Summary 
Although the webpage is useful, the fact that the text has to directly match to what is on the data is a major drawback. Something that can be implemented is providing autofills or dropdown boxes to select from the search filter. This would help by not having the user look at the whole raw data to know what they can or cannot input in the text box to search. Another thing that can be added is the option to put just a month or year in the date search filter and so it can filter only sightings based off from a month or year. If one wants to make the site a little more interesting and intreging, would be by adding a heat map to where one can see where there have been more sightings and have the option to click on the heat map and bring up the data table in relation to the heat map.
